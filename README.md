# CLG ASSIGNMENT 3
Lesson 4 - Javascript

INSTRUCTIONS
Declare a function that will use the Window method, setTimeout(). Within this function

set delays to your console log messages,

then set delays to other functions being executed

Use the setInterval() Window method to repeatedly call a function

Stop the setInterval() method by calling clearInterval()

Find the location object by running a console.log statement on your window API (your browser)

Then find the history object for your same window

Run a back and forward method to discover your session history

Now, within a function, use the localStorage property of the Window object to store some data strings with the setItem method

Check if your data is stored in the console with the getItem method

Try closing your tab, clearing your console, and then check if the data you stored in localStorage still exists in the console

As an extra activity for this lesson, research third-party APIs. We’ll be learning more about third-party APIs later in the course so don’t worry about doing too much self-directed learning, this is an extra bonus step for good measure.
